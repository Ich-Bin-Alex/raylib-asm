# Raylib ASM

Simple example to show how x64 Assembler and Raylib work together

## Compilation

Run the `compile.sh` script. You need to have Raylib installed.

The code works only on Linux at the moment. To make it work on Windows, you need to change the `tools.asm` file and write your own compile script.
